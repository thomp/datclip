# datclip

Show the content of the primary selection and the clipboard in an emacs buffer.

## Installation

Save datclip.el somewhere. Add a line to your ~/.emacs file which directs emacs to load datclip.el:

```
(load "/some/path/to/datclip.el")
```

## Use

The default binding to show selection and clipboard content is 's-c' (the 'Super' key and the 'c' key).

Press 'q' when you're done working with the datclip buffer.
